Data-Driven Strategy for Microsoft Film Studio's Debut Release (Flatiron , project:1)
The libaries our Notebook put in use were:
Numpy: For data cleaning/graphing
Matplotlib: To visualize our data
Pandas: To clean the data and organize them for our purpose. 
Seaborn: To make attractive visuals
Our datasets that were put in use were imported from:
imdb.com 
thenumbers.com  
themoviedb.com.
We created a cleaning function to apply to our datasets
We used pandas to clean each dataset from its orignal source.
We joined the IMdb datasets into a single master dataframe
Joined the tn and tmbd into a single master dataframe = 'grand dataframe'
Isolated the tn and tmbd master dataframe to the years 2000-2018
Used matplotlib and grand dataframe to display different bar charts with different metrics:
(first dictionary of bar charts): The number of films each genre made from 2000-2018
(second dictionary of bar charts):'Percent Share of Total Market Films'
(third dictionary of bar charts): Profit in Billions (USD) for each genre
(fourth dictionary of bar charts): Percent Share of Total Market Revenue for each genre
To establish the most profitable action based actors we created a dataframe from the tn/tmbd datasets but this time isolating the elements inside the dataframe
Then got the average profit per movie for each actor and created a dictionary 
Then Caluclated the probabilty of the profitability of each actor 
With those two findngs we created a new dataframe called: 'cast_stats_df'
We then filtered the dataframe to only display the reliable actors
We created a scatter plot with matplotlib to diplay profit vs production budget.
The last 'result' section protrays which descion we went with and why.
